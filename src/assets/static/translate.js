        description: "## How does JavaScript Work?@@@@@@> JavaScript是如何工作的@@@@@@JavaScript is a client-side scripting language and one of the most efficient, commonly used scripting languages. The term .client-side scripting language means that it runs at the client-side( or on the client machine) inside the web-browsers, but one important thing to remember is that client's web-browser also needs to support the JavaScript or it must be JavaScript enabled. Nowadays, most of the modern web browsers support JavaScript and have their JavaScript engines. For example, Google Chrome has its own JavaScript engine called V8.",

It’s the idea that your code should be precise and as close to perfect as possible. If you have more code than you need, it shouldn’t be there. There shouldn’t be anything superfluous, and I go so far as to say that there shouldn’t even be superfluous whitespace. You want your code to be as efficient, readable, and maintainable as possible, and instead of only “solving the problem.” I always put in the extra time to also focus on the design of my code.",
