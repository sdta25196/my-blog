        description: "## What Is Clean Code?@@@@@@> 什么是简洁代码@@@@@@Clean code is a philosophy that I follow when I code. Actually, to me, it feels more like a religion than a philosophy! It’s the idea that your code should be precise and as close to perfect as possible. If you have more code than you need, it shouldn’t be there. There shouldn’t be anything superfluous, and I go so far as to say that there shouldn’t even be superfluous whitespace. You want your code to be as efficient, readable, and maintainable as possible, and instead of only “solving the problem.” I always put in the extra time to also focus on the design of my code.",
