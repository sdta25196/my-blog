## Activating Prior Knowledge With English Language Learners

> 激活英语学习者的先验知识

Activating prior knowledge means both eliciting from students what they already know and building initial knowledge that they need in order to access upcoming content.

> 激活先验知识意味着两件事：从学生那里引导出他们已经知道的知识和为他们将要学习的内容构建基础知识

We have found this strategy to be essential to teaching all of our students, both those who are proficient in English and those who are acquiring English language skills. To go even further, this strategy lies at the heart of our teaching philosophy—our students already possess a wealth of knowledge and experiences they can build upon as they encounter new learning. It’s up to us to facilitate this process by developing relationships with our students so that we learn what they already know and ensure that they feel comfortable sharing it.

> 我们发现这个策略对我们的学生来说是至关重要的，无论是精通英语的学生还是正在学习英语语言技能的学生。进一步说，这一策略是我们的核心教学理念，我们的学生已经拥有大量的知识和经验，他们能够在遇到新的知识时，继续学习。我们需要通过发展与学生的关系来促进这一过程，这样我们就能学到他们已经知道的东西，并确保他们乐于分享。
